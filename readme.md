# Instructions

Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily. You can build utilities, games, infographics, and more. You can also integrate, display, and analyze social media and large data sets without having to create and curate them yourself.

- **Use at least 1 of the supplied APIs to grab data from at least 6 items from that API.** For example, 6 books on Open Library, or 6 movies from the Open Movie Database.

- **Display these items on a page in an attractive gallery of images or titles.**

- **Clicking the image or title, opens a lightbox just as in the Interactive Lightbox project earlier with detailed information about the item.**

## Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

_7 steps_

**Use one of the following APIs:**

- [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
- [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
- [Steam](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#JSON)
- [Star Wars](https://swapi.co/)
- [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/)
- [Pokemon](http://www.pokeapi.co/)
- [Github](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
- [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/)

**It's okay to use a second API of your choosing, but you must use at least one of the APIs on the list.**

**Make sure to use endpoints that do not require an API key or the use of OAuth for this project.**

**Grab at least 6 items from the API. For example 6 movies from Open Movie Database, 6 Albums from Spotify.**

**Display these 6+ total items in an attractive gallery**

- See the api-thumbnail-page.png mockup file. You don't need to use photos if the API doesn't provide them. Clickable item titles work as well. Or you can use regular photos (not photos retrieved from the API) as thumbnails.
- Click a thumbnail to open a lightbox with displaying details of the item

  - Name/title
  - Description
  - Image
  - Other relevant data such as date, categories, price

**Put your project in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account:**

- See the workshop on Using GitHub for the Degree Program. The GitHub Desktop application can automatically create a new repository for you.
- Make sure that you're only putting the files for this project in that repository.

**Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.**

- Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
- There are a few exceptions that you don't need to fix:

  - Don't worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
  - If CSS validator flags use of calc, or vendor prefixes pseudo-elements/pseudo-classes these errors should be ignored.
  - If HTML validator flags use of pipe ('|') in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored

**You should also check for issues with your JavaScript code using JSHint, linked in the Project Resources.**

- JSHint may show you some warnings, so make sure to check through those for any potential problems.
- You do not need to fix every warning listed but reviewing them can be useful.

**NOTE:** A good practice is to check your project for cross browser compatibility. Making sure that it looks and functions correctly in multiple (at least three) browsers is an important part of being a top-notch developer. If you want, leave a comment to the project reviewer about which browser(s) the project was checked to ensure they are seeing things as you have designed them.

Some browser options:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Internet Explorer/Edge
- Safari

## Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

- Use more than 1 API - If you decide to find your own second API, make sure the API is public and does not require authentication to use it. Do not use any that require a API key or OAuth for this project.
- Add a way to sort the information by categories such as date or name
- API provides more than 6 items
- Add a way to move back and forward when the lightbox is visible to switch between detail popups.
